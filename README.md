# LIDD coding platform support site

The Limits to Direct Democracy (LIDD) is an ERC funded research project that investigates the relationship between popular sovereignty as expressed through forms of direct democracy and the rule of law. The project seeks to establish where the the limits of direct democracy should be drawn.

This website supports the LIDD coding platform by providing coders/annotators with additional resouces and documentation.
