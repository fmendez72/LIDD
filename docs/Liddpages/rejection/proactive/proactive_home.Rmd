The Country Reports are listed according to the two main routes:

##### 1. Pre-signature admissibility test route

##### 2. Post-signature admissibility test route


The only difference between the two is that for the `Pre-Signature` cases we include an extra table of results for the `Admissibility rates` of initiatives that passed the signature threshold.
