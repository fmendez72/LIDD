## Overall conceptualisation

>This image can be mostly ignored it is more of a placeholder at this stage.

## Taxonomy of instruments and admissibility models

> FM comment: I suspect we want (i) a general taxonomy for a given instrument and (ii) a narrow typology for the different admissibility models. In this framework (ii) is a subset of features belonging to (i)

## QCA models

> Below are a couple of ways to think of a potential QCA model.

>In this version some of the variables may be the same as above (we need to discuss labels). FM's preferred approach would be to integrate all instruments into the same QCA model (ie Agenda, Proactive and Reactive).
